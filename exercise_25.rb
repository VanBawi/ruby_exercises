# Exercise 25
# Given an input string with alphanumeric characters, extract the integers into a list and print them out in the order of occurrence.
# If there is a dash (-) immediately before a number, it will be deemed as a negative number and it is a different number from the positive
# Bonus: Include the number of times the integer occured in total in the entire string for each integer

# e.g. Your output should be:
# The numbers are: -23, 1, 578, -12, 7, 23, ...

# If you attempt the bonus, uour output should be:
# The numbers found are:
# -23: 3 times
# 1: 3 times
# 578: 2 times
# -12: 3 times
# 7: 4 times
# 23: 1 time
# â€¦ etc
